# Certificate Management

## Feature Overview
The Certificate Management section provides tools for generating, managing, and tracking certificates of authenticity for products. This includes certificate templates, generation workflows, and verification systems.

## Technical Implementation

### Certificate List View
- Complete certificate directory
- Status tracking
- Search and filtering
- Quick actions
- Batch operations

### Certificate Generation
- Template selection
- Data population
- QR code generation
- Digital signature
- PDF generation

### Certificate Verification
- QR code scanning
- Digital signature verification
- Status checking
- History tracking
- Fraud prevention

## API Integration
- `GET /api/certificates`: Fetch certificate list
- `POST /api/certificates/generate`: Generate new certificate
- `GET /api/certificates/:id`: Get certificate details
- `GET /api/certificates/verify/:id`: Verify certificate
- `POST /api/certificates/:id/revoke`: Revoke certificate
