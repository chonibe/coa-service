# Cursor Rules for COA Service

## Deployment Rule - CRITICAL
**ALWAYS DEPLOY TO VERCEL WHEN COMPLETING A FEATURE OR TASK**

When you complete any feature, task, or significant change:
1. Commit all changes with a descriptive commit message
2. Deploy to Vercel production using: `vercel --prod --yes`
3. Verify deployment success
4. Document any deployment notes or issues

This ensures all completed work is immediately available in production.

## Project-Specific Rules

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Use shadcn/ui components when available
- Prefer functional components with hooks

### File Organization
- Components in `/app/[feature]/components/`
- API routes in `/app/api/[feature]/`
- Types in `/types/`
- Documentation in `/docs/features/[feature-name]/`

### Testing
- Test all new features before marking complete
- Verify mobile responsiveness
- Check error handling
- Test edge cases

### Documentation
- Update feature README when adding features
- Document API endpoints
- Include usage examples
- Update implementation summaries
