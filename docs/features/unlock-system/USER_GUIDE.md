# Unlock System User Guide

## Overview

Unlockable series turn art into a journey. When you create a series with unlock mechanics, collectors experience progression, anticipation, and reward — just like in games, drops, loyalty programs, and Patreon tiers.

## Unlock Types

### Finish the Set (Sequential)

**How it works:** Artworks unlock one by one in order. Collectors must purchase artwork #1 to unlock #2, then #2 to unlock #3, and so on.

**Why it works:** Satisfies the collector instinct to "finish the set." Each purchase naturally leads to the next.

**Best for:** Series where you want collectors to experience the full journey in order.

### Time-Based Unlocks

**How it works:** Artworks unlock at specific times or on recurring schedules (daily, weekly).

**Why it works:** Creates anticipation and daily return behavior. More attention over more days.

**Best for:** Building daily engagement, creating anticipation for releases, scheduled drops.

### VIP Unlocks

**How it works:** Exclusive pieces unlock for collectors who own earlier works or meet loyalty requirements.

**Why it works:** Rewards loyalty and makes owning earlier pieces matter. Builds a hierarchy that keeps collectors inside the ecosystem.

**Best for:** Rewarding early supporters, creating exclusive tiers, building collector loyalty.

### Any Purchase

**How it works:** All artworks unlock immediately when any piece is purchased.

**Why it works:** Open collections where collectors can access everything right away.

**Best for:** Open collections, starter series, accessible entry points.

## Real-World Analogies

Collectors instantly recognize these patterns:

- **Games**: Unlock achievements, complete quests, level up
- **Drops**: Scheduled releases, limited-time availability
- **Loyalty Programs**: Earn points, reach tiers, unlock rewards
- **Patreon Tiers**: Support levels, exclusive content, early access

No learning curve. They already know: "I unlock this by time / by owning / by completing."

## Why It Matters

### 1. Scarcity appears automatically.

The structure creates demand — you don't need to manufacture hype.

### 2. Retention becomes self-reinforcing.

Collectors who start a series rarely stop midway.

### 3. Artists generate their own momentum.

You scale without micromanaging drops.

### 4. The platform becomes a world, not a shop.

Collectors follow artists the way people follow stories.
