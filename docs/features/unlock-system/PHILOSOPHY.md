# Unlock System Philosophy

## One Sentence Version

Unlockable series turn art into a journey, and journeys create loyalty, repeat purchases, and cultural value.

## Why Unlocks Exist

We let artists upload their work and define how their drop unlocks because it turns Street Collector into a creator-led collectible system, not a storefront.

Unlockable series make art behave like progression, and progression is the strongest driver of repeat engagement.

### Sequential Unlocks (Finish the Set)

→ Satisfy the collector instinct to "finish the set."

→ Each purchase naturally leads to the next.

### Time-Based Unlocks

→ Create anticipation and daily return behavior.

→ More attention over more days.

### VIP Unlocks

→ Reward loyalty and make owning earlier pieces matter.

→ Build a hierarchy that keeps collectors inside the ecosystem.

That's it. No bloat.

## Why Collectors Get It Immediately

These patterns already exist in their world:

- Games
- Drops
- Loyalty programs
- Patreon tiers

They instantly recognize:

"I unlock this by time / by owning / by completing."

No learning curve.

## Why It Matters (The Real Reason)

### 1. Scarcity appears automatically.

The structure creates demand — you don't need to manufacture hype.

### 2. Retention becomes self-reinforcing.

Collectors who start a series rarely stop midway.

### 3. Artists generate their own momentum.

You scale without micromanaging drops.

### 4. The platform becomes a world, not a shop.

Collectors follow artists the way people follow stories.

## Implementation

The unlock system is designed to be:

- **Simple**: Clear patterns that collectors recognize immediately
- **Flexible**: Support sequential, time-based, VIP, and custom unlocks
- **Engaging**: Create natural progression and retention loops
- **Creator-Led**: Artists control their own drop mechanics
