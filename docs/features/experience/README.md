# Shop Experience Page

## Overview

The Experience page (`/shop/experience`) lets users customize a Street Lamp with artwork. It includes an intro quiz, a 3D Spline preview, an artwork strip, filters, and checkout.

**Implementation**: [`app/shop/experience/`](../../../app/shop/experience/)

## Performance Optimizations (2026-02)

### Implemented

1. **Streaming + Suspense** – Page shell renders immediately; data streams in via `loading.tsx` and Suspense fallback.
2. **Lazy Spline 3D** – `Spline3DPreview` is loaded with `next/dynamic` only when the configurator mounts.
3. **Lightweight product payload** – `getCollectionWithListProducts` uses `PRODUCT_LIST_FRAGMENT` (no description, media, full variants) for the artwork strip; full product fetched on-demand when opening ArtworkDetail.
4. **Virtualized ArtworkStrip** – `@tanstack/react-virtual` renders only visible rows (~10–15 cards instead of 100+).
5. **Reduced motion** – `whileHover` / `whileTap` removed from ArtworkCard to cut scroll-time JS work.
6. **Error boundaries** – Configurator and Spline wrapped in `ComponentErrorBoundary` for graceful degradation.

### Image Optimization (Optional)

Current config has `images: { unoptimized: true }` in [next.config.js](../../../next.config.js).

- **Re-enable optimization**: Set `unoptimized: false` and add `remotePatterns` for Shopify domains (e.g. `cdn.shopify.com`). Requires compatible image provider support.
- **Keep unoptimized**: If external CDN constraints apply, keep `unoptimized: true` and consider Shopify URL size parameters (e.g. `_medium`, `_large`) where available to reduce transfer.

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /api/shop/products/[handle]` | Full product for ArtworkDetail (on-demand) |
| `GET /api/shop/artists/[slug]` | Artist bio/filter when arriving from `?artist=` link |

## Data Flow

- **Initial load**: Lamp (`getProduct`), Season 1 & 2 collections (`getCollectionWithListProducts`) in parallel.
- **Detail drawer**: When user opens artwork detail, full product fetched via `/api/shop/products/[handle]` and cached in memory.
