# Vendor Payout Guide

Welcome! This guide explains how to receive payments for your sales on the platform.

## How Payouts Work

When customers purchase your artwork, you earn a **25% commission** on each sale. Once orders are fulfilled (shipped), your earnings become available for withdrawal.

## Getting Started

Before you can request a payout, make sure your profile is complete:

1. **PayPal Email** - We send all payments via PayPal
2. **Tax Information** - Required for tax compliance
3. **Terms Accepted** - Agree to the vendor terms of service

To update these, go to **Settings** in your vendor dashboard.

## Requesting a Payout

1. Go to **Payouts** in your dashboard
2. Your available balance shows at the top
3. Click **Request Payment** when you have $25 or more
4. Your request goes to our team for approval
5. Once approved, payment is sent to your PayPal

## Minimum Payout

The minimum payout amount is **$25 USD**. This helps reduce transaction fees for both you and us.

If your balance is below $25, you'll see a message showing how much more you need.
