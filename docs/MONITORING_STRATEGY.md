# Monitoring and Observability Strategy

## Overview

Our monitoring strategy is designed to provide comprehensive visibility into the Street Collector platform's performance, reliability, and operational health.

## Core Principles

1. **Comprehensive Logging**: Capture detailed system events and interactions
2. **Performance Tracking**: Monitor system and application performance
3. **Error Tracking**: Proactively identify and diagnose issues
4. **Security and Compliance**: Ensure secure and controlled access to monitoring data

## Monitoring Components

### 1. Logging System

#### Log Levels
- `DEBUG`: Detailed development and troubleshooting information
- `INFO`: General operational events
- `WARN`: Potential issues that don't prevent system functioning
- `ERROR`: Significant problems requiring immediate attention
- `CRITICAL`: Severe issues demanding immediate intervention

#### Logging Targets
- Console output during development
- Persistent storage in Supabase
- Potential future integration with external logging services

### 2. Performance Metrics

#### Tracked Metrics
- Operation duration
- Success/failure status
- Detailed performance context
- Resource utilization tracking

### 3. Error Tracking

#### Error Capture
- Full error details
- Contextual information
- Stack trace preservation
- Severity classification

### 4. Webhook Monitoring

#### Webhook Management
- Event-driven webhook triggering
- Delivery attempt tracking
- Retry mechanism
- Comprehensive logging of webhook interactions

## Security Considerations

- Row-level security on all monitoring tables
- Admin-only access to sensitive monitoring data
- Secure storage of webhook secrets
- Prevention of sensitive information logging

## Implementation Details

### Database Tables
- `system_logs`: Comprehensive event logging
- `performance_metrics`: System performance tracking
- `error_tracking`: Detailed error logging
- `webhook_destinations`: Webhook integration management
- `webhook_delivery_logs`: Webhook delivery tracking

### Access Control
- Strict policies limiting access to admin users
- Granular permissions on monitoring data

## Monitoring Workflow

1. **Event Occurrence**: System event or operation triggered
2. **Logging**: Detailed information captured
3. **Performance Tracking**: Metrics recorded
4. **Error Detection**: Potential issues identified
5. **Alerting**: Critical issues flagged for immediate attention

## Best Practices

- Minimize performance overhead
- Avoid logging sensitive information
- Use appropriate log levels
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Regularly review and analyze logs

## Future Roadmap

- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Real-time monitoring dashboard
- Advanced log analysis and visualization
- External alerting system integration

## Compliance and Governance

- GDPR-compliant data handling
- Secure data retention and deletion
- Audit trail maintenance
- Transparent monitoring practices
