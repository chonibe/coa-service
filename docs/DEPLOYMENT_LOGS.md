## Domain Configuration Debugging [$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')]

### Current Status
- No custom domains assigned to Vercel project
- `dashboard.thestreetlamp.com` assigned to another project
- 404 errors on dashboard routes

### Domain Conflict Resolution Strategies
1. Project Domain Coordination
   - Contact domain management team
   - Request domain reassignment
   - Verify DNS and routing configurations

2. Temporary Routing Alternatives

### Authentication Flow Insights
1. Cookie-based Authentication
   - Verify Shopify Customer ID
   - Check Access Token presence
   - Validate customer route matching

2. Redirection Scenarios
   - Missing Customer ID → `/login`
   - Missing Access Token → `/api/auth/shopify`
   - Customer ID Mismatch → Redirect to correct dashboard

### Debugging Enhancements
- Added timestamp to log entries
- Captured full request context
- Implemented granular authentication checks

### Potential Investigation Points
- Shopify OAuth configuration
- Cookie management
- Session handling mechanisms

## Domain and Routing Configuration [$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')]

### Routing Strategy Enhancements
1. Case-Insensitive Path Handling
   - Normalize dashboard routes
   - Support varied URL capitalizations
   - Improve cross-domain compatibility

2. Domain Allowlist Implementation
   - Define explicit allowed domains
   - Comprehensive domain validation
   - Flexible routing across environments

### Key Configuration Updates
