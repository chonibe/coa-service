## Dashboard Route Debugging [$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')]

### Identified Issues
- Potential domain configuration conflict
- Authentication route handling complexity
- Middleware routing challenges

### Debugging Strategies
- Enhanced middleware logging
- Strict customer ID validation
- Explicit authentication checks

### Middleware Modifications
- Added comprehensive route logging
- Implemented strict authentication validation
- Created explicit customer ID matching

### Recommended Next Steps

- Validate Shopify OAuth flow
- Test authentication scenarios
- Monitor server-side logs

### Potential Root Causes
1. Domain misconfiguration
2. Authentication token management
3. Routing middleware complexity

## Domain Configuration Debugging [$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')]

### Current Status
- No custom domains assigned to Vercel project
- `dashboard.thestreetlamp.com` assigned to another project
- 404 errors on dashboard routes

### Domain Conflict Resolution Strategies
1. Project Domain Coordination
   - Contact domain management team
   - Request domain reassignment
   - Verify DNS and routing configurations

2. Temporary Routing Alternatives
   - Use Vercel-generated deployment URL
   - Implement server-side redirects
   - Update client-side authentication flow

### Recommended Immediate Actions
- Verify Shopify OAuth configuration
- Review DNS settings
- Check middleware authentication logic
- Test with Vercel-generated URL

### Potential Root Causes
1. Domain misconfiguration
2. Project-level routing restrictions
3. OAuth token management issues

## Middleware Authentication Debugging [$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')]

### Comprehensive Logging Strategy
- Enhanced middleware logging
- Detailed authentication context capture
- Strict validation of customer routes

### Authentication Flow Insights
1. Cookie-based Authentication
   - Verify Shopify Customer ID
   - Check Access Token presence
   - Validate customer route matching

2. Redirection Scenarios
   - Missing Customer ID → `/login`
   - Missing Access Token → `/api/auth/shopify`
   - Customer ID Mismatch → Redirect to correct dashboard

### Debugging Enhancements
- Added timestamp to log entries
- Captured full request context
- Implemented granular authentication checks

### Potential Investigation Points
- Shopify OAuth configuration
- Cookie management
- Session handling mechanisms

## Domain and Routing Configuration [$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')]

### Routing Strategy Enhancements
1. Case-Insensitive Path Handling
   - Normalize dashboard routes
   - Support varied URL capitalizations
   - Improve cross-domain compatibility

2. Domain Allowlist Implementation
   - Define explicit allowed domains
   - Comprehensive domain validation
   - Flexible routing across environments

### Key Configuration Updates
- Added support for multiple domain variations
- Implemented case-insensitive route matching
- Enhanced logging for domain-specific routing

### Supported Domains
- `dashboard.thestreetlamp.com`
- `street-collector-chonibes-projects.vercel.app`
- `localhost:3000`

### Debugging Insights
- Improved visibility into routing logic
- Simplified domain-specific handling
- Reduced potential routing conflicts

### Next Investigation Points
- Verify domain propagation
- Test cross-environment routing
- Monitor performance impact
