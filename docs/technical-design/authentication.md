# Customer Dashboard Redirect Handling

## URL Parsing Improvements

### Customer ID Extraction
The authentication callback now supports multiple URL formats for customer ID extraction:

- `/dashboard/6435402285283`
- `/customer/dashboard/6435402285283`
- URLs ending with a customer ID number

### Extraction Logic
The system uses a flexible regex-based approach to extract customer IDs:
- Multiple patterns are tried to match different URL formats
- Fallback mechanisms ensure robust ID extraction
- Comprehensive logging aids in debugging redirect issues

### Redirect Flow
1. Attempt to extract customer ID from redirect URL
2. Prioritize extracted ID over original parameters
3. Normalize redirect path to ensure consistent routing
4. Set authentication cookies with extracted customer ID

## Debugging
Enhanced logging provides detailed information about:
- Raw redirect paths
- Extracted customer IDs
- Redirect processing steps

### Troubleshooting
- Check server logs for detailed redirect information
- Verify customer ID extraction in authentication callback
