# Order Line Items Migration Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive migration strategy for transitioning from the legacy `order_line_items` table to the new `order_line_items_v2` table.

## Migration Goals
- Maintain 100% data integrity
- Minimize downtime
- Provide backward compatibility
- Ensure seamless transition for existing applications

## Technical Implementation

### Compatibility Layer
We've implemented a PostgreSQL view that acts as a compatibility layer between the old and new table structures:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW order_line_items AS
SELECT * FROM order_line_items_v2;
```

#### View Triggers
INSTEAD OF triggers have been implemented to handle:
- INSERT
- UPDATE
- DELETE

### Verification Scripts

#### Data Consistency Verification
`scripts/verify-order-line-items-migration.ts` performs:
- Record count comparison
- Data integrity checks
- Sample record insertion/update/deletion tests

#### Code Reference Update
`scripts/update-order-line-items-references.sh` automates:
- Updating import statements
- Replacing table references
- Logging migration changes

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Compatibility and Verification
- [x] Create compatibility view
- [x] Develop verification scripts
- [x] Create comprehensive test suite

### Phase 2: Code Refactoring
- [ ] Run reference update script
- [ ] Validate all application code
- [ ] Update documentation references

### Phase 3: Gradual Transition
- [ ] Monitor application performance
- [ ] Collect migration metrics
- [ ] Plan complete migration timeline

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Tests
- Full test coverage for view functionality
- Data integrity verification
- Performance impact assessment

### Manual Verification
- Code review of migration scripts
- Staging environment testing
- Incremental rollout

## Potential Risks
- Data loss during migration
- Performance overhead from view
- Unexpected application behavior

## Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive backup before migration
- Staged rollout approach
- Ability to quickly revert changes

## Monitoring and Logging
- Implement detailed logging for migration scripts
- Set up performance monitoring
- Create rollback procedures

## Success Criteria
- 100% data preservation
- Zero downtime
- No performance degradation
- Successful application functionality

## Future Improvements
- Optimize view performance
- Develop automated migration tools
- Create migration dashboard
