# Sprint: Customer Dashboard Implementation

## Objective
Implement a comprehensive customer dashboard that links authenticated users to their order line items, NFC tags, and digital certificates.

## Sprint Backlog

### Authentication and Session Management
- [ ] Verify and optimize Supabase authentication flow
- [ ] Ensure `customer_id` is consistently populated in orders table
- [ ] Create middleware to handle session-based access control

### Database Preparation
- [ ] Audit `orders` and `order_line_items_v2` tables for consistent customer linking
- [ ] Create database view or function to aggregate customer order information
- [ ] Add indexes to improve query performance for customer-related queries

### Backend Implementation
- [ ] Develop `/api/customer/dashboard` endpoint
  - Retrieve orders
  - Fetch associated line items
  - Collect NFC tag information
  - Aggregate digital certificate details

### Frontend Development
- [ ] Design dashboard layout
- [ ] Create React components for:
  - Order history
  - NFC tag management
  - Digital certificate display
- [ ] Implement data fetching hooks
- [ ] Add error handling and loading states

### Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for dashboard data retrieval
- [ ] Perform integration testing
- [ ] Conduct user acceptance testing

### Performance and Security
- [ ] Implement caching strategies
- [ ] Add rate limiting to dashboard API
- [ ] Verify row-level security configurations

## Success Criteria
- Users can view their complete order history
- NFC tag status is clearly displayed
- Digital certificates are accessible
- Dashboard loads within 200ms
- 99% of customer interactions are supported

## Potential Challenges
- Handling users with multiple orders
- Performance with large order histories
- Ensuring data privacy and security

## Out of Scope
- Advanced filtering
- Detailed order tracking
- Complex data visualizations

## Estimated Timeline
- Sprint Duration: 2 weeks
- Estimated Story Points: 21

## Resources Required
- 1 Backend Developer
- 1 Frontend Developer
- 1 QA Engineer

## Risks
- Incomplete customer ID mapping
- Performance bottlenecks
- Authentication edge cases

## Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive data migration script
- Implement robust error handling
- Conduct thorough performance testing
