# NFC Tag Management Enhancement Story

## Overview
This branch focuses on improving the NFC tag management system, addressing current limitations and introducing new features to enhance tracking, assignment, and usability.

## Current Challenges
- Manual NFC tag verification process
- Limited bulk action capabilities
- Inconsistent tag status tracking
- Complex assignment workflow

## Proposed Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Tag Status Management
- Implement more granular status tracking
- Add new status categories:
  - `reserved`
  - `in_production`
  - `quality_check`
  - `ready_for_deployment`

### 2. Bulk Management Features
- Bulk tag assignment
- Batch status updates
- Mass programming capabilities
- Advanced filtering options

### 3. Workflow Optimization
- Streamlined programming process
- Automated status transitions
- Real-time tracking dashboard
- Integrated quality control checks

### 4. Technical Enhancements
- Improve database schema for NFC tags
- Add comprehensive logging
- Implement robust error handling
- Create more detailed audit trails

## Implementation Roadmap
