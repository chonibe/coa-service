## [2026-04-18] feature | Restore per-artwork unlock editor; retire series studio block editor

**Checklist**
- [x] [`app/vendor/(app)/studio/artworks/[id]/experience/page.tsx`](app/vendor/(app)/studio/artworks/[id]/experience/page.tsx) — Resolves submission → `shopify_product_id`, then `router.replace` to [`/artwork-editor/[productId]`](app/artwork-editor/[productId]/page.tsx) (blocks, soundtrack, map, preview). If not published yet, “Publish first” + link to edit.
- [x] [`app/vendor/(app)/studio/page.tsx`](app/vendor/(app)/studio/page.tsx) — **Unlock** → per-artwork experience route (no series template editor).
- [x] [`app/vendor/(app)/studio/nfc/page.tsx`](app/vendor/(app)/studio/nfc/page.tsx) — Artwork name links to `/artwork-editor/{productId}` when programmed.
- [x] [`app/vendor/(app)/studio/series/[id]/experience/page.tsx`](app/vendor/(app)/studio/series/[id]/experience/page.tsx) — Replaced with guidance pointing to Studio → Artworks → Unlock.
- [x] [`app/vendor/(app)/studio/series/[id]/experience/editor/page.tsx`](app/vendor/(app)/studio/series/[id]/experience/editor/page.tsx) — Redirects to the guidance page (no `SeriesTemplateEditor` in AppShell).
- [x] [`app/vendor/(app)/studio/series/page.tsx`](app/vendor/(app)/studio/series/page.tsx) + [`series/[id]/page.tsx`](app/vendor/(app)/studio/series/[id]/page.tsx) — Menu / header: “Unlock on artworks” → `/vendor/studio`; empty-state copy updated.
- [x] [`app/vendor/dashboard/artwork-pages/series/[seriesId]/page.tsx`](app/vendor/dashboard/artwork-pages/series/[seriesId]/page.tsx) — Comment: legacy dashboard-only series editor.

**Note**: Product create flow unchanged — no Hidden Treasures / benefits UI restored on artwork.

**Vercel**: Production deploy completed (2026-04-18); alias `https://app.thestreetcollector.com`.

## [2026-04-18] fix | Add artwork wizard: Continue visible on desktop

**Checklist**
- [x] [`app/vendor/dashboard/products/create/components/shopify-style-form.tsx`](app/vendor/dashboard/products/create/components/shopify-style-form.tsx) — Removed `lg:hidden` from the sticky step footer so **Back** / **Continue** / final **Submit** show at `lg+`; step indicator `n / 4` always in that bar.

**Vercel**: Production deploy completed (2026-04-18).

## [2026-04-18] feature | Remove per-artwork Hidden Treasures UI; artist delete vs close listing

**Checklist**
- [x] [`app/vendor/dashboard/products/create/components/series-step.tsx`](app/vendor/dashboard/products/create/components/series-step.tsx) — Removed Hidden Treasures / per-artwork benefits UI from the series step; rely on series-level unlock experience instead.
- [x] `app/vendor/dashboard/products/create/components/benefits*` — Deleted standalone benefits forms and `benefits-management` stack (no remaining imports).
- [x] [`supabase/migrations/20260418140000_product_submission_status_closed_draft.sql`](supabase/migrations/20260418140000_product_submission_status_closed_draft.sql) — Adds enum values `draft` and `closed` (idempotent `DO $$ … EXCEPTION duplicate_object`).
- [x] [`app/api/vendor/products/submissions/[id]/close/route.ts`](app/api/vendor/products/submissions/[id]/close/route.ts) — `POST` sets `status` to `closed` for `published` / `approved` (artist-initiated only).
- [x] [`app/api/vendor/products/submissions/[id]/route.ts`](app/api/vendor/products/submissions/[id]/route.ts) — `PUT` blocked when `closed`; `DELETE` allowed when no active sales and not already closed.
- [x] [`app/api/vendor/products/submissions/route.ts`](app/api/vendor/products/submissions/route.ts) — List filter accepts `draft` and `closed`; lint fixes (`const` maps, omit join field).
- [x] [`app/vendor/(app)/studio/page.tsx`](app/vendor/(app)/studio/page.tsx) — Delete when unsold; **Close listing** for any published/approved (artist choice); closed cards do not deep-link into edit; filter tab for closed.
- [x] [`app/vendor/(app)/studio/artworks/[id]/edit/page.tsx`](app/vendor/(app)/studio/artworks/[id]/edit/page.tsx) — Clearer message when submission is `closed`.

**Deploy / DB**: Apply the migration to Supabase before relying on `closed` / `draft` in production. Closing is DB-only (no Shopify unpublish in this change).

**Vercel**: Production deploy completed (2026-04-18); alias `https://app.thestreetcollector.com`.

## [2026-04-18] deploy | Studio: series cover upload, images, series deep-link, series-only benefits, block editor route

**Checklist**
- [x] [`app/vendor/(app)/studio/series/new/page.tsx`](app/vendor/(app)/studio/series/new/page.tsx) — Cover upload uses `POST /api/vendor/media-library/upload`; reads `file.url`; clearer upload errors.
- [x] [`next.config.js`](next.config.js) — `images.remotePatterns` includes `**.supabase.co` so `next/image` works for Supabase Storage (series cards, artwork picker, media library).
- [x] [`app/vendor/(app)/studio/media/page.tsx`](app/vendor/(app)/studio/media/page.tsx) — List query `sort=date_desc` (was invalid `newest`).
- [x] [`app/vendor/(app)/studio/artworks/new/page.tsx`](app/vendor/(app)/studio/artworks/new/page.tsx) — `?series=` resolves series name (list + fallback `GET /api/vendor/series/:id`); cancel returns to series when deep-linked.
- [x] [`app/vendor/(app)/studio/series/[id]/experience/editor/page.tsx`](app/vendor/(app)/studio/series/[id]/experience/editor/page.tsx) — AppShell route re-exports `SeriesTemplateEditor` (same as new block editor).
- [x] [`app/vendor/(app)/studio/series/[id]/experience/page.tsx`](app/vendor/(app)/studio/series/[id]/experience/page.tsx) — Primary CTA links in-app to `/experience/editor` (no external dashboard tab).
- [x] [`app/vendor/(app)/studio/page.tsx`](app/vendor/(app)/studio/page.tsx) — Submissions map `seriesId`; card opens **Edit**; **Unlock** → series editor or series index.
- [x] [`app/vendor/(app)/studio/artworks/[id]/experience/page.tsx`](app/vendor/(app)/studio/artworks/[id]/experience/page.tsx) — Explains series-wide NFC; routes to series editor when submission has `series_id` or `?series=`.
- [x] [`app/vendor/dashboard/products/create/components/benefits-management.tsx`](app/vendor/dashboard/products/create/components/benefits-management.tsx) + [`series-step.tsx`](app/vendor/dashboard/products/create/components/series-step.tsx) — With a series, benefits are **series-level only** (no per-artwork toggle); standalone per-artwork treasures UI replaced with copy pointing to Series → Unlock experience.
- [x] [`app/vendor/(app)/studio/nfc/page.tsx`](app/vendor/(app)/studio/nfc/page.tsx) — Artwork link goes to `/vendor/studio/series` instead of per-artwork editor.
